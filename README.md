Some changes have been done on the navegator section. The semanthic HTML has been added with different CSS added too. The purpose of modify tags, It's to have better understanding about what the code does. It also added a "<ul></ul>" and "<li></li>" to have a better performance on the navegator section. Finally,now when someone scroll over the "gmail" or "imagenes" word, those ones turn on a green color.
